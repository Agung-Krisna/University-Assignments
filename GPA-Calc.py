#GPA CALCULATOR, Agung Krisna, 2021.
"""
Normal way to do it:
def GPA(value):
    if value >= 85 and value <= 100:
        print ("A+")
    elif value >= 80 and value <= 85:
        print ('B')
    ...
    very inefficient. especially without switch-case.

#if you're curious, all of this only took 23 lines of code (LoC), but due to the comments I made, it got into 57 lines of code
